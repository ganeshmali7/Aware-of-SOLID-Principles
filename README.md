# SOLID Principles in C#

This repository demonstrates SOLID principles using simple C# examples.

---

## 1️⃣ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

*A class should have only one reason to change*

### Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SRP_Violated.cs | One class handling multiple responsibilities |
| SRP_Followed.cs | Responsibilities divided into separate classes |

---

## 2️⃣ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

*Open for extension, closed for modification*

### Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| OCP_Violated.cs | Uses conditional logic for vehicle types |
| OCP_Followed.cs | Uses abstraction to extend behavior |

---

## 3️⃣ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

*Subclasses should be replaceable without breaking behavior*

### Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| LSP_Violated.cs | Incorrect inheritance (e.g., Bicycle with engine logic) |
| LSP_Followed.cs | Proper abstraction & hierarchy |

---

## 4️⃣ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

*Do not force clients to implement unnecessary methods*

### Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ISP_Violated.cs | Fat interface with unrelated methods |
| ISP_Followed.cs | Small, specific interfaces |

---

## 5️⃣ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

*Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes*

### Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| DIP_Violated.cs | High-level module depends on concrete class |
| DIP_Followed.cs | Uses interface & dependency injection |
